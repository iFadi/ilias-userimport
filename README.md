## What is it for?
This tool is used to convert a massive number of users from a (CSV, Excel) file to a XML file that can be imported in the [ILIAS e-Learning System](http://www.ilias.de/), originally this tool was developed to simplify the import of users to a separate ILIAS installation which is used only for the purpose of eExams(eKlausuren) and has specific local roles, here are a list of features which this tool can apply to the imported users list:
* Set a generated or united password to all users.
* Set a Global/Local Role.
* Set Limited Access. (i.e. only on the day of the exam)
* Generate dummy accounts (i.e. for test purposes)
